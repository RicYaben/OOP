 * Week 5 â€“ Problem 10
 *
 * Read number n from the console. Then read n numbers (integers), and print the minimum and maximum sum given by a
 * combination of n-1 numbers.
 * (If the user enters 5 numbers, you need to find out of those four numbers that give the maximum sum and four numbers
 * that give the minimum sum).
 *
 * Do not use arrays to solve this problem!
